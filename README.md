# Staircase-problem
Consider a staircase of size *n*
>    #
>   ##
>  ###
> ####

its base and height are both equal to *n*, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. 
The last line is not preceded by any spaces. The last line must have 0 spaces in it.

###To Run
> python staircase.py
>[Enter N]

####Note
I thought this was a neat puzzle. So I decided to implement it in Python because I love python.
